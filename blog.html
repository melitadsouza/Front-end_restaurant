				<p><b>The Restaurant is one of the plush restaurants we have in ic colony. This is the place where we normally go for expensive treats. The ambience of the place is good, nice lighting and quite spacious. One half of it is used as a party hall. In terms of food, this restaurant truely lives up to its name. For appetizers, they have a huge spread. Chicken platter is worth trying. Chicken lollipops are nice.Manglorians, have a chicken speciality called kori roti which is the highlight among the chicken dishes here. Definitely worth a try every time you come here. They have a huge roti basket which is delicious. All different kinds of roti in one, makes you ask for more. You wont get seafood anywhere better than this place. Pomfret, bangda, prawns etc etc and their different dishes are a delight. Dont ever miss the sizzlers here. They are just amazing, delicious, falling short of words to describe it. The sauce in it is just mouth watering. Best sizzler you can get anywhere in borivli. Gravy dishes here are also good. In deserts, caramel custard is good. The tinge of lemon in it just rocks it. Chocolate mouse and kulfi are also good. Overrall, great place to bring your friends and families along on a quiet sunday evening.<p>Well, over all experience is good and given that there are limited options for casual dining in the colony, this place comes to the rescue.</p>
